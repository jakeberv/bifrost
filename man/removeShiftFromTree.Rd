\title{Remove a Shift from a Phylogenetic Tree by Reverting to Parent State}
\usage{
removeShiftFromTree(tree, shift_node, stem = F)
}
\description{
This function removes a regime shift from a SIMMAP-style phylogenetic tree by repainting the subtree
starting at a specified node with the state of its parent node. It uses \code{paintSubTree_removeShift()}
to selectively revert the painted shift without affecting unrelated branches, with optional stem edge handling.
