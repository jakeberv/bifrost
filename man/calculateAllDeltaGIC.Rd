\title{Calculate ΔGIC Scores Relative to a Baseline Model}
\usage{
calculateAllDeltaGIC(model_results, painted_tree_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_results}{A list of model fit results, typically the output of
\code{\link{fitMvglsAndExtractGIC.formula}} or a similar function.
Each element must be a list containing at least a \code{GIC} component,
where \code{GIC$GIC} is a numeric scalar.
The first element is treated as the baseline model.}

\item{painted_tree_list}{A named list of painted phylogenetic trees
(objects of class \code{simmap}). The names are used as identifiers
for the output vector of ΔGIC values. Every element must have a
non-\code{NULL} name.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of ΔGIC scores, where each value is:
\deqn{\Delta GIC_i = GIC_\mathrm{baseline} - GIC_i}
Positive values indicate that the candidate model improves the fit
relative to the baseline (lower GIC = better model).
}
\description{
Computes the difference in Generalized Information Criterion (GIC) scores
between a baseline model (assumed to be the first element of \code{model_results})
and one or more alternative models fitted to painted phylogenetic trees.
This allows rapid comparison of model fit across candidate regime-paintings.
}
\details{
This function is a convenience wrapper for comparing multiple models
on the same dataset. By subtracting each candidate model's GIC from the
baseline GIC, the resulting values are on a common, interpretable scale.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Assume we have a baseline and two alternative models
  baseline <- list(GIC = list(GIC = 100))
  alt1     <- list(GIC = list(GIC = 95))
  alt2     <- list(GIC = list(GIC = 105))

  model_results <- list(baseline, alt1, alt2)
  painted_tree_list <- list(
    Baseline = "tree1",
    ShiftA   = "tree2",
    ShiftB   = "tree3"
  )

  calculateAllDeltaGIC(model_results, painted_tree_list)
  # Named vector: Baseline=0, ShiftA=5, ShiftB=-5
