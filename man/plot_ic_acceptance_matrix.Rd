\title{Plot IC Acceptance Matrix with Optional Rate-of-Improvement Overlay}
\usage{
plot_ic_acceptance_matrix(
  matrix_data,
  plot_title = "IC Acceptance Matrix Scatter Plot",
  plot_rate_of_improvement = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix_data}{A two-column \code{matrix} or \code{data.frame}. Column 1 must be
numeric IC scores in evaluation order; Column 2 must be a logical or numeric flag
(0/1) indicating whether the step was accepted.}

\item{plot_title}{\code{character(1)}. Title to draw above the plot.}

\item{plot_rate_of_improvement}{\code{logical(1)}. If \code{TRUE}, overlay the
first differences of the IC series on a secondary (right) y-axis along with a
horizontal reference line at zero.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. Called for its plotting side effects.
}
\description{
Create a two-layer base R plot that visualizes information criterion (IC) scores
across a sequence of sub-model evaluations, highlighting which steps were
\emph{accepted} vs \emph{rejected}. Optionally, a secondary y-axis overlays the
\strong{rate of improvement} (first difference of IC scores) as a line with markers.
}
\details{
The function expects a two-column object where:
\itemize{
\item Column 1 contains the IC score at each step (numeric; lower is better).
\item Column 2 contains an indicator for acceptance (0 = rejected, 1 = accepted).
}
The first IC value is treated as the \emph{baseline} and is plotted as a larger
black point and labeled. Accepted steps are drawn as blue filled points connected
by a thin line; rejected steps are drawn as small red crosses. When
\code{plot_rate_of_improvement = TRUE}, the function overlays a secondary y-axis on
the right that shows \code{diff(IC)} values (the per-step change in IC; more negative
implies improvement).

The function uses only base graphics. It sets plot margins and \code{mgp} via
\code{par()}, and (when overlaying) uses \code{par(new = TRUE)} to layer the IC plot over the
rate-of-improvement axes. It does not restore previous graphical parameters.

\strong{Axes and scaling.} Tick marks for the primary (IC) x/y axes are computed with
\code{pretty()} to give clean bounds. The secondary axis for the rate of improvement
uses fixed limits (\code{c(-400, 150)}) inside the function; adjust in source if your
expected \code{diff(IC)} range differs substantially.

mat <- cbind(ic, c(1, accepted))  # mark baseline as accepted for plotting
