\title{Paint a Subtree in a Phylogenetic Tree with Optional Selective Overwriting}
\usage{
paintSubTree_mod(
  tree,
  node,
  state,
  anc.state = "1",
  stem = FALSE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
}
\description{
This function modifies a phylogenetic tree (of class "phylo") by painting a specified subtree
starting at a given node with a new state, optionally preserving existing state mappings unless overwritten.
It returns a SIMMAP-style tree with updated edge mappings and supports both full and selective painting,
as well as optional stem painting from the parent edge.
