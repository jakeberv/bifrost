Description: Methods for detecting and visualizing cladogenic shifts in multivariate trait data on phylogenies. Implements penalized-likelihood multivariate generalized least squares models, enabling analyses of high-dimensional trait datasets and large trees via searchOptimalConfiguration(). Includes a greedy step-wise shift-search algorithm following approaches developed in Smith et al. (2023) <doi:10.1111/nph.19099> and Berv et al. (2024) <doi:10.1126/sciadv.adp0114>. Methods build on multivariate GLS approaches described in Clavel et al. (2019) <doi:10.1093/sysbio/syy045> and implemented in the mvgls() function from the 'mvMORPH' package. Documentation and vignettes are available at <https://jakeberv.com/bifrost/>, including the introductory vignette at <https://jakeberv.com/bifrost/articles/jaw-shape-vignette.html>.
